# Quick Summary: Why "content-section" Class Was Not Found

## The Real Issue (Not What We Initially Thought!)

You were **100% correct** - the class `content-section` **DOES exist** on the page!

The error message "Scoped element not found" was **misleading**. The real problem is:

### 🔴 **Root Cause: Network Access Issue**

**Your URL**: `https://intranet.dtgo.com/...` 

This is an **intranet/internal company URL**:
- ✅ **Your browser** can access it (you're on company network/VPN)
- ❌ **Docker container** cannot access it (isolated from your network)
- ❌ **Crawler never gets the HTML**, so it never sees the `content-section` class

## What Actually Happens

1. Your browser → ✅ Can reach intranet.dtgo.com
2. Docker backend → ❌ Times out trying to reach intranet.dtgo.com  
3. Crawler gets timeout/error page (no `content-section` in error HTML)
4. Shows "Scoped element not found" ❌ (should say "Network timeout")

## Quick Solutions

### ✅ Solution 1: Use Host Network (Easiest)

Edit `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  backend:
    network_mode: "host"  # Add this line
    # ... rest of config
```

Then restart:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### ✅ Solution 2: Run Backend Locally (For Intranet URLs)

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000
```

### ✅ Solution 3: Test with Public URL First

Verify the crawler works correctly:
```bash
# Try with example.com first
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/crawl/single \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com", "mode": "content", "scope_class": "content-section"}'
```

## What I Fixed (Still Helpful!)

Even though the root cause is network access, I improved the crawler:

1. ✅ **Better element finding** - Now tries 3 different methods to find elements
2. ✅ **Better error messages** - Shows available classes when element not found  
3. ✅ **Network error detection** - Properly distinguishes timeout vs missing element
4. ✅ **Diagnostic info** - Shows which classes exist in the HTML

## How to Verify It's Fixed

### Test 1: Check if Docker can reach your intranet

```bash
docker exec webcrawler-backend curl -I https://intranet.dtgo.com
```

- If you get a response → Network is OK
- If it times out → Network issue (use Solution 1 or 2)

### Test 2: Try the extraction again

Once network is fixed, retry your extraction:
- URL: `https://intranet.dtgo.com/Whats-New/News/...`
- Mode: Content  
- Scope Class: `content-section`

You should now see:
- ✅ Element found successfully
- ✅ Content extracted from the scoped element

## TL;DR

**Problem**: Intranet URL not accessible from Docker container  
**Solution**: Use `network_mode: "host"` in docker-compose.yml OR run backend locally  
**Bonus**: Improved error messages will now tell you it's a network issue, not a missing element!
